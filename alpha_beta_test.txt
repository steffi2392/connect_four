This is an example of a game played between two SmartAIPlayers using alpha-beta pruning with 10 seconds to search.  Player 1 won this game, and it appeared to be played pretty much as perfectly as it could have played.  (I've played against SmartAIPlayer with alpha beta pruning and have yet to beat it - of course this doesn't prove that it's playing perfectly, but in 4th grade I won my grade's Connect Four tournament, so I'll take this to mean SmartAIPlayer is pretty good.)  A good bit more states are visited at each depth than the search without alpha-beta pruning; in general it allows for about 1 additional level of the tree to be explored each time.
